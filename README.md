## To-Do

There is much to do!!! This is an initial commit.

## Evangelism

I believe people **do** better when they have a better working mental model.

Technology comparison articles frustrate me as frequently rife with

- us vs. them thinking / emotive / tribal think (along with consequent ad hominem attacks)
- strawman arguments
- a lack of precision about the factors under consideration
- conflation of how an alternative might score for some decision factor with the total relevance of the factor. For example, there is a lot of "yeah choice X may not be great at thing Y but Y is completely stupid and no one needs it".

As humans we tend towards all of the above. That's OK. We also build tools to overcome our limits. This is just a small toy project but maybe some group can use it to communicate better

- separating and communicating situational elements (factor weights) from factor scoring.
- quantifying relative scoring.
